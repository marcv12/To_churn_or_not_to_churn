# Customer Churn with Python and Streamlit

Through this project, you will be able to predict whether customers in your bank will churn (leave) or not. I have also provided a website that implements this automatically, where all you have to do is upload a file.  

For more information, I will provide **2 links**: one contains the report for the project (**fun and easy to follow!**) and the other a video where you will be able to see how the website works and how wonderfully well it works!  

I really hope you enjoy this project as much as I did doing it, and if you have any comments, I would be glad to respond!
